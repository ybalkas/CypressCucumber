Cypress Cucumber Framework
Description
This project integrates the powerful browser testing tool Cypress with the Cucumber testing framework to enable Behavior Driven Development (BDD) in web application testing. By combining Cypress with Cucumber, we can write our tests in plain English, allowing developers, QA, and non-technical stakeholders to collaborate and understand the tests.

Features
Cypress Integration: Leverage Cypress for end-to-end browser testing.
Cucumber BDD: Use Gherkin syntax to define test scenarios in a human-readable format.
Step Definitions: Reusable step definitions to keep your code DRY.

Prerequisites:
Node.js (version 12 or higher recommended)

npm (usually comes with Node.js)

Writing Tests
Create Feature Files: Write your tests in Gherkin syntax within .feature files located in the cypress/integration directory.

Implement Step Definitions: Define step implementations in the cypress/e2e/.. Use these steps to interact with your web application through Cypress commands.
